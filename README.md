### Features

**Intro**

This project features a webpage using responsive design, which aims to deliver a comfortable user experience across multiple platforms.

In desiging this project, we only need a few tools that are actually available for free.

Firstly, our favorite web browser or tool. Of course we should expect some degree of disparity when deciding which to use.

Secondly, we establish majority of our work on VSCode. This is where we write most of the HTML and CSS used to design this project.

The next couple tools that will have a brief mention are GitBash, Github, and Figma.

We'll talk about those when we get there.

For the HTML, we primarily went with flex as most of it was simple to align with just a few properties. Or rather just a simple object or two as the case with the header and footer.

We did decide to use grid display for the cards, hoping to make it more consistent across displays with the repeat and auto fit lines. While for the most part, the flex boxes were adjustable enough with justify-content.
